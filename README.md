# Algorithm Visualizer in Java 

Developed by [@Swapnamoyop](https://github.com/Swapnamoyop) 

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
**Algorithm Visualizer** is a Java-based desktop application that visually demonstrates the step-by-step execution of different sorting algorithms.  
It provides an interactive and educational way to understand how algorithms work internally, by animating the sorting process in real-time.  

This project was built using **Java Swing** for the UI, **Graphics2D** for custom rendering, and **SwingWorker** for multithreading, ensuring smooth animations without freezing the interface.

## ðŸ“œ Project Motivation  
This project was developed to help students, beginners, and enthusiasts grasp sorting algorithms intuitively.  
Instead of reading static diagrams, learners can see exactly how values are swapped, compared, and placed in real-time.  
The goal is to create an engaging learning tool while improving skills in Java GUI development, multithreading, and graphics programming.
